# Technical Approach & Methodology

## Core Methodology

### Container-First Development
Our container-first approach forms the foundation of our development philosophy:

- Built on containerization from day one, not as an afterthought
- Isolated, secure environments for development, testing, and production
- Consistent application behavior across all deployment stages
- Enhanced security through container isolation
- Portable solutions that run anywhere containers are supported
- Standardized development environments
- Simplified operational scaling
- Optimized resource utilization

### Comprehensive Testing
Our testing methodology ensures continuous quality validation across every stage:

- Continuous testing integrated into every environment
- Clear, digestible reporting that drives decisions
- Test-driven development practices
- Complete coverage: unit, integration, end-to-end
- Performance testing for scalability
- Security testing in development pipeline
- Automated testing frameworks
- Environment-specific strategies
- User acceptance validation
- Load and stress verification

### Security Integration
Security is built into our process from architecture to deployment:

- Security by design in all containers
- Automated security testing
- Clear security boundaries
- Continuous compliance monitoring
- Supply chain security
- Vulnerability scanning
- Access control validation
- Security metric tracking
